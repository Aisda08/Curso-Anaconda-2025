    "We see increasing amounts of costs related to engine strikes at a mass of 4, and this greatly increases at 5. This makes sense because big aircraft carry a lot of inconvenienced passengers, and they also likely have the most expensive engines needing replacement. It's also interesting to note that huge aircraft have negligible costs related to non-engine strikes. "
